## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

During the internship, I worked with the following technologies to build a complete web development environment:

| Technology / Tool | Purpose | Emoji |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----- |
| 🐍 **Python (Flask)** | Lightweight web server to display messages and handle HTML templates | `localhost:5000` |
| 🐘 **PHP** | Runs via built-in PHP server or Apache for dynamic web pages | `localhost:8080 / 80` |
| ⚡ **Apache HTTP Server** | Serves PHP pages in a stable, production-like environment | `localhost:80` |
| 💾 **MySQL Database** | Stores and manages data such as books, users, and categories | Database management |
| 🖥️ **Visual Studio Code** | Main IDE for development | Code editing & extensions |
| 🔌 **VS Code Extensions** | Python, PHP extensions | Syntax highlighting & tools |
| 🐳 **Command Prompt / Terminal** | Running servers, installing packages | CLI commands |

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The internship involved setting up a **development stack** for a simple library system:

1. **Python (Flask)**:  
   - Lightweight server to display messages  
   - Handles HTML templates in the `templates` folder  
   - Runs on `localhost:5000`

2. **PHP**:  
   - Can run via the built-in server (`localhost:8080`)  
   - Can also be served via Apache (`localhost:80`) for a production-like setup  

3. **MySQL Database**:  
   - Stores book records, categories, and user activity  
   - Provides structured data access for web applications  

4. **Apache HTTP Server**:  
   - Serves PHP applications reliably  
   - Provides a stable local web server environment  

This setup forms the **foundation for building more advanced features** in the library management system.

## ⚙️ Setup Summary

- **Python / Flask**:  
  - Install Python → Install Flask → Run `app.py`  
  - Access web page: `http://localhost:5000`

- **PHP**:  
  - Install PHP → Create `index.php` → Run PHP server  
  - Access web page: `http://localhost:8080`

- **MySQL**:  
  - Install MySQL Server & Workbench  
  - Configure root account & default options

- **Apache**:  
  - Install Apache → Configure `httpd.conf` for PHP → Start server  
  - Access web page: `http://localhost`

---

## 📌 Notes

- All servers run on **localhost** and are **only accessible from the local machine**  
- Paths for PHP and Apache are set to `C:\php` and `C:\Apache24`  
- Python Flask server runs independently and can coexist with Apache + PHP  

---

## 🎯 Goals Achieved

- ✅ Set up a working development environment  
- ✅ Built basic Python and PHP web servers  
- ✅ Connected servers to a MySQL database  
- ✅ Ran Apache to serve PHP pages  
- ✅ Learned the integration of web server, database, and dynamic content

## 🧠 Tools Used 
- ChatGPT AI Tool for assistance and code optimization
- Copilot for assistance

- This repository contains all tasks, projects, notes, and documentation created during my internship at the Public Library. The purpose of this internship is to gain practical experience in library operations, digital systems, archiving, user support, and any technical or administrative activities assigned throughout the program. ✨

Key Tasks During the Internship 🛠️
During the internship, I was involved in a variety of practical tasks, including:

📖 Registering new books and materials in the library system.
✅ Verifying the accuracy of metadata.
🗂️ Assisting in the organization and maintenance of the library collection.
💻 Managing digital databases.
🖨️ Assisting with digitization of files.

Tools Used 🧰
🧠 ChatGPT AI tool for guidance and drafting.
🤖 GitHub Copilot for code and documentation assistance.
In general, we worked with CSV, Excel, and RFID. ✅

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple text file format used to store and exchange data in a table-like structure. Each line in the file represents a record, and the values are separated by commas (or another delimiter), making it easy to open in programs like Excel, Google Sheets, or to read with programming languages. It is ideal for simple data storage and for transferring information between different applications.

Excel is a spreadsheet program that helps organize and manage data, such as a collection of books. You can list titles, authors, genres, or publication dates, and sort or filter the books to find what you need quickly.

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) in libraries is used for the organization, management, and automation of book lending. Each book has an RFID tag with a unique code, which can be read by RFID readers without removing the book from the shelf or needing a direct line of sight. This allows for automated book borrowing and returning with high speed and accuracy.

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the practical experience gained, the skills developed, and the contributions made during the internship. 🎯

Alongside the tasks mentioned above, I also worked with **Excel** to *record data for books 📚* that had not yet been cataloged, so that they could later be added to the database. Additionally, I gained experience with the **RFID system**, which allows for *quick identification and tracking of books 📖* based on the unique identifier stored on their tags 🔖.
