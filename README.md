Welcome to the repository documenting my internship experience!

## Key Tasks During the Internship 🛠️

During the internship, I was involved in a variety of practical tasks, including:

In general, we worked with the following: ✅

- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a simple text file format used to store and exchange data in a table-like structure. Each line in the file represents a record, and the values are separated by commas (or another delimiter) making it easy to open in programs like Excel or Google Sheets. Ideal for simple data storage and transferring information between applications. 📄✨

- **Excel** is a spreadsheet program that helps organize and manage data, such as a collection of books 📚. You can list titles, authors, genres, or publication dates, and sort or filter the books to find what you need quickly. 🔍

- **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** in libraries is used for the organization, management, and automation of book lending. Each book has an RFID tag with a unique code, which can be read by RFID readers without removing the book from the shelf 📚➡️📡. This allows for automated book borrowing and returning with high speed and accuracy ⚡.

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the practical experience gained, the skills developed, and the contributions made during the internship. 🎯😄

Alongside the tasks mentioned above, I also worked with Excel to record data for books 📚 that had not yet been cataloged, so they could later be added to the database. Additionally, I gained experience with the RFID system, which allows for quick identification and tracking of books 📖 based on the unique identifier stored on their tags 🔖🙂.
