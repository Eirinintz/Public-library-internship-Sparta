## Generally 🎯

Alongside the tasks mentioned above, I also worked with Excel to record data for books 📚 that had not yet been cataloged, so they could later be added to the database. Additionally, I gained experience with the RFID system, which allows for quick identification and tracking of books 📖 based on the unique identifier stored on their tags 🔖🙂.

In general, we worked with the following: ✅

- 📄 **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a simple text file format used to store and exchange data in a table-like structure. Each line in the file represents a record, and the values are separated by commas (or another delimiter) making it easy to open in programs like Excel or Google Sheets. Ideal for simple data storage and transferring information between applications. 📄✨

- 📊 **Excel** is a spreadsheet program that helps organize and manage data, such as a collection of books 📚. You can list titles, authors, genres, or publication dates, and sort or filter the books to find what you need quickly. 🔍

- 📡 **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** in libraries is used for the organization, management, and automation of book lending. Each book has an RFID tag with a unique code, which can be read by RFID readers without removing the book from the shelf 📚➡️📡. This allows for automated book borrowing and returning with high speed and accuracy ⚡.

- 🐍 **Python** is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readable syntax and ease of use. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, automation, and machine learning. With a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, Python allows developers to build powerful applications quickly and efficiently. 🚀💻

- 🐘 **PHP** is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is widely used to create dynamic websites and web applications, and can easily interact with databases like MySQL. With a large ecosystem of frameworks and tools, PHP allows developers to build scalable and efficient web solutions. 🌐💻

- 🌐 **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a website, using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. HTML works together with CSS and JavaScript to build interactive and visually appealing websites. 💻✨

- 🐬 **MySQL** is another widely-used relational database system, known for speed and reliability, often used in web applications alongside frameworks like Django, PHP, or Node.js. ⚡🌐

- 📊 **PostgreSQL** is a powerful open-source relational database system, known for stability, reliability, and advanced features. It works seamlessly with Django for storing and managing structured data. 🗄️✅

- 🛠️ **pgAdmin** is a popular GUI tool for managing PostgreSQL databases, making it easier to create, query, and maintain databases. 👩‍💻🔍

- 💻 **Django** is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to build robust and scalable web applications quickly. It comes with built-in features like authentication, ORM, and templating. 🐍🌐
  
- 🌟 **Laravel** is a modern PHP web framework designed to make web application development easier, faster, and more elegant. It provides features like routing, authentication, ORM (Eloquent), templating (Blade), and testing tools. Laravel is mainly used to build robust, secure, and scalable web applications, from small projects to large enterprise systems. 💻⚡
